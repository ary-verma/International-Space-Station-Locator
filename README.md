This is a system that locates the International Space Station (ISS) and provides a visual representation of the location on the world map, with respect to its latitude and longitude.

The above image shows the location where the timestamp is 2021-03-31 10:40:33.

working:
This program uses the data from a JSON file which keeps on updating as the ISS changes its location. The data can be found here: http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json. I used the library Plotly to plot the location on the world map as seen in the program.
